# Who is closer?
### This is a little side project to learn some React native
### The prinice of the game is simple. You will add names of all players and then you will be presented with a question. For example 'How far is the moon (in kilometers)?' and each player is going to guess the closest number. Who is winner is quite obvious. What happens to the winner or looser is up the group and the rules they come up with.

#### Technologies:
- React native
- Expo
- Typescript

#### How to start the game:
Unfortunetely the game is not published either to App store or Google play, since it is a practice project.
But you can fork or clone the repo and write in terminal:

```sh
yarn start
```
You can check it out on localhost or downloand the Expo GO app and scan the QR code from terminal.

The design choice is little weird but if you are interested it is called Neo-brutalism
